Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4">this video</a> 
I wondered which is the optimal number of filters if I want to shift the polarization of the light by 90 degrees. So I made a quick interactive notebook under the following assumptions: 
<ol>
  <li>Filters can polarize light only perpendicular to its travel direction</li>
  <li>You can only have whole number of filters, and that must be at least 2</li>
  <li>Filters have a cost to use, and the performance decrease in the amount of the light passes the filters has another cost</li>
  <li>The notebook must be user friendly, which means it should update as soon as the values change</li>
</ol>

Play with it, modify it, break it, fix it, enjoy it :)
